# Facial-Landmarking-and-Blink-Detection
This is a python project which is uses facial landmarks to identify blinks. 
## Following are the dependencies:
1. OpenCV
2. Dlib
3. Imutils
3. Numpy

The above mentioned are the required python packages. Along with that, we need dlib c++ library.

It uses EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio) to detect blinks

**Note:** : Make sure you have [dlib](http://dlib.net/) installed along with a c++ compiler.
